# 06_ClassificationOfNewsArticlesByCategory_202401100400046
In this project, we aim to classify news articles into categories like Sports, Tech, Business, and more, using simple metadata. This helps organize large volumes of information, making it easier for users to access relevant content.

The dataset includes:

word_count — total words in the article.

has_keywords — a binary flag for keyword presence.

read_time — estimated reading time.

category — the target label.

We used a Random Forest Classifier, an ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to boost accuracy and reduce overfitting. The model's performance was evaluated using a Confusion Matrix, along with metrics like Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.

This project highlights a practical, beginner-friendly approach to news classification and underlines the importance of both feature selection and model evaluation in machine learning.
